It provides us with [numerous excellent features](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZFS), such as snapshotting, incremental send/receive, and transparent compression. With the recent release of [Ubuntu Xenial 16.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes) official support for [ZFS is now here](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/02/16/zfs-is-the-fs-for-containers-in-ubuntu-16-04/), and we are keen to integrate it fully into our next generation hosting stack.\n\nAs a Node.js and MongoDB house, one of our main concerns has been how MongoDB will perform on ZFS on Linux, especially after reading about [potential problems](http://serverfault.com/questions/583688/mongodb-and-zfs-bad-performance-disk-always-busy-with-reads-while-doing-only-wr) other people have faced. There really isn't much data out there to put our minds at rest.\n\nWe decided to setup a method of benchmarking MongoDB with the supported EXT4 and XFS, then compare against ZFS with different options enabled. The idea being that we can hopefully figure out how ZFS compares, and if there are any options we can set that will impact the performance in any noticeable way. \n\nThere are a few caveats to our testing, so we are aware that these results need to be taken with a pinch of salt. They are aimed at just providing an indicator as to the performance between the file systems, not being a definitive guide to which is best to use.\n\n## Setup\n\nThe main variable that may affect the results was the hardware that we chose to use. We spun up a 4GB Linode instance with four cores, and four virtual disks: one for the latest Ubuntu 15.10 image (which we then upgraded to 16.04), and one disk for each of the file systems that we intended to test, EXT4, XFS and ZFS.\n\nThe issue with this approach is that the system is running on a virtualised machine with shared hardware, so there may be variations in the performance available to the machine. In an ideal world we would run this on a physical machine with identical disks, but that wasn't feasible for this investigation.\n\nWe decided to use the latest stable version of MongoDB 3.2.5, ZFS was at version 0.6.5.6 provided by the zfsutils-linux package for Xenial.\n\nTo benchmark the performance we investigated a few options, such as [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB), and even writing our own benchmark based on examples of our real world data and queries. However we settled on using a Java-based tool, [sysbench-mongodb](https://github.com/tmcallaghan/sysbench-mongodb). This made it easy to configure and run consistent and repeatable tests that would push the database to its limits. \n\n## Methodology\n\nFirst the drives were mounted to directories reflecting their filesystems, this made it easy to switch the file system that MongoDB was using.\n\n```\nFilesystem  Type  Size  Used  Avail  Use%  Mounted on\n/dev/sda    ext4  7.7G  1.8G  5.5G   25%   /\n/dev/sdc    ext4   20G  44M   19G    1%    /ext4\n/dev/sdd    xfs    20G  33M   20G    1%    /xfs\ntank        zfs    19G  0M    19G    0%    /zfs\n```\n\nThe drives were setup and formatted with the default options of `mkfs.ext4` and `mkfs.xfs` and `zpool create`. I then wrote a script, [that can be found here](https://gist.github.com/bag-man/95cc7cc7ad7046bbe2bc30f01c0f73bd), to utilise these disks with the sysbench-mongodb utility, and log the results. If you want to see the specific commands that we used, please have a look at the script.\n\nThe way the script works is by destroying and recreating the ZFS volume with the option that is being tested, then starting a mongod instance, using the filesystems mount point as the dbpath. For example `mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath /zfs`. Then we simply run the sysbench-mongo script, and pull out the results of the run.\n\nThe parameters we decided to test for ZFS are listed below:\n\n```\nDefaults (ashift = 0, recordsize = 128K, compression = off)\nDefaults & ashift = {9,12}        \nDefaults & recordsize = {8KB,64KB}        \nDefaults & compression = {lz4,gzip}        \n```\n\nWe also edited the sysbench-mongodb config ever so slightly. We opted to use the `FSYNC_SAFE` write concern to ensure that the data was getting written to disk, and not just stored in RAM. We also reduced the number of documents per collection to `1,000,000` tenfold less than the default `10,000,000`. This was simply to save time on each “Load” step, something we aren't too concerned with as our applications are principally read-heavy.\n\nAfter running the benchmarks for each of the separate filesystems ten times and recording the  last cumulative average of the inserts per second for the “Load” stage of the benchmark, and the last cumulative average of the transactions per second for the “Execute” stage, we could create a representative average of the performance for each filesystem. \n\n\n## Results\n![Results](https://i.imgur.com/or6Lskm.png)\n\n\nYou can download the [raw data here](http://downloads.clock.co.uk/mongo_on_zol-results.tar.xz) if you want to perform your own analysis of the results.\n\nAs we suspected, ZFS doesn’t perform quite as well as the other filesystems, but it is worth noting that with the default settings it is only slightly slower. Most importantly, we didn’t uncover any show-stopping performance issues, as hinted in the discussions that are linked above. Unless you are looking to get the utmost performance in your queries, then ZFS certainly looks to be a viable option. Moreover, we feel that the benefits gained by utilising ZFS are more than worth the minor performance penalties. \n\nThis investigation has been far from definitive, but hopefully has provided you with a rough overview of how these filesystems perform. If you know of ways to help us improve the results, or performance of MongoDB on ZFS, please do let us know, we are keen to hear your experiences!","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p><em>This was written during my time at Clock.</em></p>\n\n<p>Here at Clock we love ZFS, and have been running it in production on our Linux file servers for several years.

Which is great and all, but for jazz music at a dance event all that stuff isn't really necessary. However it is great to be able to take advantage of some of the more basic functions that Mixxx provides that you won't find in other music players.\n\n### Installation\nMixxx is open source and available for all platforms, you can download it [here](http://www.mixxx.org/download/#stable) or install it via your package manager if you are on Linux. \n\n### Appearance\nOnce you have it installed it is easy to get put off by the large amount of buttons and options, however bear with it, we can make the UI a lot nicer to work with. \n\n![Default Mixxx skin](http://i.imgur.com/8GI3vtR.png)\n\nI recommend installing the [FlatNite theme](https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8578) by ronso, and then clicking the hamburger menu by the clock to toggle off the panels that you don't need, then you can make it look like this.\n\n![FlatNite Theme in minimal mode](http://i.imgur.com/OEMTqIc.png)\n\n\n### Usage\nThe way I organise my music on Mixxx is to create .m3u8 playlists, for each genre of music. This lets me manage my library really easily, and make it quick to find tracks for the right moments. \n\nFor the actual playing of the music I use the \"Auto DJ\" to queue up music. This means you don't have to worry about manually hitting play on tracks and managing the decks. Just find the track you want and right click > \"Add to Auto-DJ Queue (bottom)\". Then you can open the Auto-DJ tab and order the tracks in response to the dance floor.\n\nYou can also set a negative fade value to give a pause in between tracks so that dancers can find a new partner.\n\n![Auto-DJ in action](http://i.imgur.com/9fnZ5fs.png)\n\n### Previewing tracks\nOne of the most useful features of Mixxx is the ability to preview a track on a separate device. To do this you need to get a USB audio device for your laptop. I bought [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01J3QGU50/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which allows me to use my wired headphones to preview music and the laptops line out to play music on the venues system. \n\nTo set this up you need to configure your two audio devices to output the channels. Go to Options > Preferences > Sound Hardware, and select the headphone device.\n\n![Audio settings](http://i.imgur.com/NqFei1U.png)\n\nIf you enable the preview track panel in the FlatNite theme you will get an area above the search where you can scrub through the previewed track and adjust the volume. \n\n### BPM Detection, or lack of\nOne thing you might be tempted to do (as I was) is to use Mixxx's auto BPM detection to fill in the meta data of your jazz library for you. The issue with this is that Mixxx is designed for electronic music with fixed a BPM throughout the track, which means BPM detection doesn't really work for Jazz unfortunately. \n\n### EQ and Gain\nMixxx also lets you easily tweak the EQ and gain for the currently playing track. This is handy if you need to boost the treble or volume on an old recording. \n\n### Conclusion\nHopefully this has given you some reasons to try out Mixxx, I think for me the most daunting thing was the sheer number of options to worry about and having to manually manage the decks.

However it is great to be able to take advantage of some of the more basic functions that Mixxx provides that you won't find in other music players.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"installation\">Installation</h3>\n\n<p>Mixxx is open source and available for all platforms, you can download it <a href=\"http://www.mixxx.org/download/#stable\">here</a> or install it via your package manager if you are on Linux. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"appearance\">Appearance</h3>\n\n<p>Once you have it installed it is easy to get put off by the large amount of buttons and options, however bear with it, we can make the UI a lot nicer to work with. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8GI3vtR.png\" alt=\"Default Mixxx skin\" /></p>\n\n<p>I recommend installing the <a href=\"https://www.mixxx.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=8578\">FlatNite theme</a> by ronso, and then clicking the hamburger menu by the clock to toggle off the panels that you don't need, then you can make it look like this.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OEMTqIc.png\" alt=\"FlatNite Theme in minimal mode\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"usage\">Usage</h3>\n\n<p>The way I organise my music on Mixxx is to create .m3u8 playlists, for each genre of music. This lets me manage my library really easily, and make it quick to find tracks for the right moments. </p>\n\n<p>For the actual playing of the music I use the \"Auto DJ\" to queue up music. This means you don't have to worry about manually hitting play on tracks and managing the decks. Just find the track you want and right click > \"Add to Auto-DJ Queue (bottom)\". Then you can open the Auto-DJ tab and order the tracks in response to the dance floor.</p>\n\n<p>You can also set a negative fade value to give a pause in between tracks so that dancers can find a new partner.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/9fnZ5fs.png\" alt=\"Auto-DJ in action\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"previewingtracks\">Previewing tracks</h3>\n\n<p>One of the most useful features of Mixxx is the ability to preview a track on a separate device. To do this you need to get a USB audio device for your laptop. I bought <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01J3QGU50/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">this</a>, which allows me to use my wired headphones to preview music and the laptops line out to play music on the venues system. </p>\n\n<p>To set this up you need to configure your two audio devices to output the channels. Go to Options > Preferences > Sound Hardware, and select the headphone device.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NqFei1U.png\" alt=\"Audio settings\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you enable the preview track panel in the FlatNite theme you will get an area above the search where you can scrub through the previewed track and adjust the volume. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bpmdetectionorlackof\">BPM Detection, or lack of</h3>\n\n<p>One thing you might be tempted to do (as I was) is to use Mixxx's auto BPM detection to fill in the meta data of your jazz library for you. The issue with this is that Mixxx is designed for electronic music with fixed a BPM throughout the track, which means BPM detection doesn't really work for Jazz unfortunately. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eqandgain\">EQ and Gain</h3>\n\n<p>Mixxx also lets you easily tweak the EQ and gain for the currently playing track. This is handy if you need to boost the treble or volume on an old recording. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Hopefully this has given you some reasons to try out Mixxx, I think for me the most daunting thing was the sheer number of options to worry about and having to manually manage the decks. Thankfully with the FlatNite theme, and the Auto-DJ feature it works really nicely for the basic needs of a Jazz DJ. </p>\n\n<p>If you have any questions please let me know on the reddit thread in <a href=\"https://redd.it/5tiogq\">/r/SwingDancing.</a></p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2017-02-12 15:25:17","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-02-12 15:25:26","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2017-02-12 15:25:26","published_by":1},{"id":6,"uuid":"ccc04a13-9061-44fe-aaa7-4acb991648f9","title":"Traditional Jazz Primer","slug":"traditional-jazz-primer","markdown":"I'm a Lindy Hop dancer and thankfully that has exposed me to the very niche genre of Traditional Jazz, Trad for short. It can also be referred to as Hot Jazz, Dixieland Jazz or NOLA / New Orleans Jazz, although the latter is usually a slightly different sound. Trad Jazz appears to be the most agreed upon term though. I'd also like to say, I'm not an expert, just some guy that loves listening and dancing to some of the best musicians in the world. \n\n## History\nTrad Jazz is the original Jazz that was first played in the early 1900's, some songs even going back to the 1890's such as [Maple Leaf Rag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMAtL7n_-rc) which was recorded in 1899! These early songs became [Jazz Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_standard) which are quite universally known by Jazz musicians today. For example here is Maple Leaf Rag [being played by the wonderful Tuba Skinny](https://youtu.be/kYJhgz4L3UU?t=22) a couple of years ago.\n\nPart of the iconic roaring 20's sound was the American Jazz, made popular by artists such as [Bix Beiderbecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bix_Beiderbecke) and [King Oliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Oliver). \n\n![King Oliver](http://img.timeinc.net/time/2002/bhm/history/images/armstrong.jpg)\n\nAs the popularity of Jazz grew in the 30's, it strayed further from it's roots in New Orleans, and started to grow into bigger bands that could fill much larger venues. This was the start of the Big Band sound, however musicians like [Sidney Bechet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Bechet) still kept the Trad sound with wild solo's and improvisations. \n\nAs we enter the 40's the popular music of the time had transitioned into full a Big Band sound, with the likes of [Glenn Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller) and [Benny Goodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman). This to me is where Trad Jazz became sidelined to the big bands of the time. \n\nToday, there is a resurgence of Trad Jazz bands, a lot of them cater specifically to the dancing community, and very few get any recognition outside of it. The upside to that is if you go to see a band there is a good chance you can have a beer with them afterwards!\n\n## Recommendations\nIf you want the best of modern recordings and New Orleans style, about as traditional as you can get, [Tuba Skinny](https://tubaskinny.bandcamp.com/) is the place to go. They have an extensive catalogue, and are to me, one of the best bands currently performing. This clip has some mad washboard solo's, which isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it has grown on me!\n\n[![Tuba Skinny Live](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FFChHrOP3D8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFChHrOP3D8)\n\nThe video that got me into this style of music was a battle of the bands between the Stockholm Swing All Stars and The Gordon Webster Band at Snowball. \n\n[![Snowball Battle of the bands](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IWr_miwwE3w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWr_miwwE3w&feature=youtu.be&t=43m23s)\n\nMy favourite clip is of Gentlemen and Gangsters, jamming with Shirt Tail Stompers, at a Lindy Exchange in Copenhagen. It happens to be my favourite song, and the solos are just so perfect. It is amazing to see them improvising so naturally.\n\n[![CLX Battle of the bands](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QLhcXJ9XBAE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLhcXJ9XBAE)\n\n## Listening Resources\nFor original recordings from the era, the best place to look is [Jazz On Line](http://www.jazz-on-line.com/).

However the site is rather old and unfriendly to use, so it make take some patience!\n\nModern bands tend to have their music on [bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), which is a great way to get DRM free music and directly support the bands that you love. The bands that aren't on it tend to have their music for sale physically via their website or CD reselling sites. \n\nIf you are interested in seeing a band live (I highly recommend it!) you should see if there is a Lindy Hop or Swing Dance event near you (There probably is), as a good event will have drawn out some quality musicians. \n\n## Musicians\nThis is a list of the bands that I listen to most, I've tried to link directly to their music, but often it is quite difficult so where I wasn't able to, I've linked to YouTube.\n\n* **[Aurora Nealand](http://auroranealand.bandcamp.com)** \n* **[Hot Jazz Aliance](https://barkingmadmusic.bandcamp.com/)** \n* **[Bix Beiderbecke](http://jazz-on-line.com/artists/Bix_Beiderbecke.htm)** \n* **[Vince Giordano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-mw6_W5Vqk)**\n* **[Dizzy Birds](https://dizzybirds.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Duke Ellington](http://jazz-on-line.com/artists/Duke_Ellington.htm)**\n* **[Eddie Condon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZnHaXgVFJY)**\n* **[Gentlemen and Gangsters](https://gentlemenandgangsters.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Carling Family Band](https://www.youtube.com/user/CarlingJazz)**\n* **[Gordon Webster](https://www.cdbaby.com/Search/R29yZG9uIFdlYnN0ZXI%3d/0)**\n* **[Stockholm Swing All Stars](http://www.stockholmswingallstars.com/listen/)**\n* **[Kid Ory](http://jazz-on-line.com/artists/Kid_Ory.htm)**\n* **[King Oliver](http://jazz-on-line.com/artists/King_Oliver.htm)**\n* **[Naomi and Her Handsome Devils](http://naomisdevils.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Patty and the Buttons](https://pattyandthebuttons.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Perseverance Jazz Band](https://perseverancejazzband.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Preservation Hall Jazz Band](https://www.preservationhalljazzband.com/releases)**\n* **[Shirt Tail Stompers](https://shirttailstompers.bandcamp.com/album/milenburg-joys)**\n* **[Shotgun Jazz Band](https://shotgunjazzband.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[Sidney Bechet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ZLsyc8EhM)**\n* **[Southside Aces](https://southsideaces.bandcamp.com/)**\n* **[The Fat Babies](http://www.thefatbabies.com/)**\n* **[The Harlem Hamfats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPNS3ACP9Kw)**\n* **[Thrift Set Orchestra](https://thriftset.bandcamp.com/releases)**\n* **[Tuba Skinny](https://tubaskinny.bandcamp.com/)**\n\nI hope this has been useful to you if you are exploring the world of Trad, or even better it has been eye opening to a whole world of new music to investigate!\n\nDrop a comment on the [reddit thread](https://redd.it/5tmw5h) if you have questions!","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>I'm a Lindy Hop dancer and thankfully that has exposed me to the very niche genre of Traditional Jazz, Trad for short.

However I like to take this idea a little further. Well, a lot further. \n\n## But why? \nIt can seem like an odd thing to someone who has never tried it, however the more you use it the more you notice the micro inefficiencies that come from reaching for a mouse, or even the arrow keys. \n\nMy thinking is, if I can save a few seconds every day from having my fingertips where they need to be, over a life time that makes a difference! Plus it looks cool to whizz around your system without moving a muscle from your keyboard.\n\nOn my Chromebook I have three modifier keys, Ctrl + Alt + Shift, when we combine those with HJKL we end up with 32 key combinations. Add to that different contexts in different applications, there should never be a reason to leave the home row!\n\n\n## Vimium / VimFX\nTo use HJKL in your browser, doesn't require that much of a configuration or change to your system at all. Just install [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) for Chrome, or [VimFX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimfx/) for Firefox. \n\nNow you can scroll pages with `hjkl`, go backwards and forwards with `H` & `L`, and switch tab with `J` and `K`. To click links, you use `f` for current tab or `F` for new tab. Then you type the letters that are on the link that you want to go to. \n\n![Vimium links](/content/images/2017/02/shot-2.png)\n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you can navigate so much quicker for most basic web browsing. It helps you practice touch typing too!\n\n\n\n## Vim\nEveryone's vim setup and workflow is different, but to tie in with my HJKL theme, I've tweaked a few things. Firstly, I mapped `J` and `K` to mimic the changing of tabs in Vimium. This is probably a controversial move, as you have to rebind the `J` key, I chose to use `M`erge lines.\n\n    nnoremap J :tabprev<CR>\n    nnoremap K :tabnext<CR>\n    nnoremap M J\n\nThe next thing I did was to enable `j` & `k` to work in drop down auto complete lists. This makes it easier to select items without moving your fingers.\n\n    inoremap <expr> j ((pumvisible())?(\"\\<C-n>\"):(\"j\"))\n    inoremap <expr> k ((pumvisible())?(\"\\<C-p>\"):(\"k\"))\n    inoremap <expr> <tab> ((pumvisible())?(\"\\<Cr>\"):(\"<Cr>\"))\n\n![Vim auto complete menu](/content/images/2017/02/shot-3.png)\n\nI also found it really handy to map `H` & `L` to jump to the beginning and ends of lines. \n\n    nnoremap H ^\n    nnoremap L $\n\n## Tiling Window Manager / Xmonad\nOn my systems I run a tiling window manager called Xmonad. Below I will give the bindings specific to Xmonad, but hopefully you can see the idea I'm getting at and apply it to your own DE / WM if you  fancy giving this a try. \n\n    -- Adjust split\n    ((mod1Mask, xK_j), sendMessage MirrorShrink),\n    ((mod1Mask, xK_k), sendMessage MirrorExpand),\n    \n    -- Workspaces\n    ((controlMask .|. mod1Mask, xK_l), nextWS),\n    ((controlMask .|. mod1Mask, xK_h), prevWS),\n    ((mod1Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_l), shiftToNext >> nextWS),\n    ((mod1Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_h), shiftToPrev >> prevWS),\n\nWhat this lets me do is resize my current window with `Alt` + `h/j/k/l`, move the current window around the workspace with `Shift` + `Alt` + `J/K`, or move it to another workspace with `Shift` + `Alt` + `H/L`. I can then also shift workspaces with `Ctrl` + `h/l`.\n\nThis means that if I have Vim on one workspace, and Chrome on the other, I can seamlessly move between them and interact with them, without moving my fingers at all! \n\n## Conclusion\nAfter having lived with this setup for the better part of two years, I am pretty happy with it, although I'm always looking for some ways to improve it, as well as a few bugs to solve. One of the most rage inducing bugs is in Chrome, viewing a PDF will stop Vimium from running, meaning you can get stuck on a tab. \n\nIf you give this a try, I'd be interested to hear how you find it, hopefully you will really notice those times you are forced to use the mouse or arrow keys. \n\nMy [dotfiles](https://github.com/bag-man/dotfiles) have a lot more configurations, so if you want to get the bigger picture check them out.

This is probably a controversial move, as you have to rebind the <code>J</code> key, I chose to use <code>M</code>erge lines.</p>\n\n<pre><code>nnoremap J :tabprev&lt;CR&gt;\nnnoremap K :tabnext&lt;CR&gt;\nnnoremap M J\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next thing I did was to enable <code>j</code> &amp; <code>k</code> to work in drop down auto complete lists. This makes it easier to select items without moving your fingers.</p>\n\n<pre><code>inoremap &lt;expr&gt; j ((pumvisible())?(\"\\&lt;C-n&gt;\"):(\"j\"))\ninoremap &lt;expr&gt; k ((pumvisible())?(\"\\&lt;C-p&gt;\"):(\"k\"))\ninoremap &lt;expr&gt; &lt;tab&gt; ((pumvisible())?(\"\\&lt;Cr&gt;\"):(\"&lt;Cr&gt;\"))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/02/shot-3.png\" alt=\"Vim auto complete menu\" /></p>\n\n<p>I also found it really handy to map <code>H</code> &amp; <code>L</code> to jump to the beginning and ends of lines. </p>\n\n<pre><code>nnoremap H ^\nnnoremap L $\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"tilingwindowmanagerxmonad\">Tiling Window Manager / Xmonad</h2>\n\n<p>On my systems I run a tiling window manager called Xmonad. Below I will give the bindings specific to Xmonad, but hopefully you can see the idea I'm getting at and apply it to your own DE / WM if you  fancy giving this a try. </p>\n\n<pre><code>-- Adjust split\n((mod1Mask, xK_j), sendMessage MirrorShrink),\n((mod1Mask, xK_k), sendMessage MirrorExpand),\n\n-- Workspaces\n((controlMask .|. mod1Mask, xK_l), nextWS),\n((controlMask .|. mod1Mask, xK_h), prevWS),\n((mod1Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_l), shiftToNext &gt;&gt; nextWS),\n((mod1Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_h), shiftToPrev &gt;&gt; prevWS),\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this lets me do is resize my current window with <code>Alt</code> + <code>h/j/k/l</code>, move the current window around the workspace with <code>Shift</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>J/K</code>, or move it to another workspace with <code>Shift</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>H/L</code>. I can then also shift workspaces with <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>h/l</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This means that if I have Vim on one workspace, and Chrome on the other, I can seamlessly move between them and interact with them, without moving my fingers at all! </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>After having lived with this setup for the better part of two years, I am pretty happy with it, although I'm always looking for some ways to improve it, as well as a few bugs to solve. One of the most rage inducing bugs is in Chrome, viewing a PDF will stop Vimium from running, meaning you can get stuck on a tab. </p>\n\n<p>If you give this a try, I'd be interested to hear how you find it, hopefully you will really notice those times you are forced to use the mouse or arrow keys. </p>\n\n<p>My <a href=\"https://github.com/bag-man/dotfiles\">dotfiles</a> have a lot more configurations, so if you want to get the bigger picture check them out. </p>","amp":null,"image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2017-02-12 19:09:52","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2017-02-12 19:54:06","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2017-02-12 19:48:57","published_by":1}],"users":[{"id":1,"uuid":"d66366f3-750e-4f80-bbf6-8033f6fdfd8d","name":"Owen Garland","slug":"owen","password":"$2a$10$qzwOK5Cxq7CnNSQfJuDTUOMBnFp50MvBJEOrs0.x4mPwy5..bM21S","email":"garland.owen@gmail.com","image":"/content/images/2017/02/shot.png","cover":null,"bio":"I'm a final year Software Engineering student at Aberystwyth University I like dancing, python, Linux, traditional jazz and node.
